a) Satwika Vemuri and Lorien Cho

b) 8.5/10

c) 20

d) 20

e) 98% -- I know that our code doesn't work for one case in Y-combinator, but I 
think the amount of effort and collaboration that both me and my partner put in 
was something neither of us had done before. And there were several times where 
we had to rework and rewrite entire functions even after going through the entire 
assignment because we found something in the spreadsheet that failed our code. 
Where I'm trying to go with all of this is that both of us put a lot of effort 
both in the lab itself as well as our coding style and I hope you see that 
reflect in our work :)

f) Case 107 makes our code never end and the last two extra credit statements
don't work either, but everything else should be good!
